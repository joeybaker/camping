## Lunch
You eat breakfast when you wake up and go right into lunch – which caries on till dinner. One of the key things about lunch is that you shouldn't have to cook, it should be quick, and easy. Here are a couple of ideas for what lunch might be on the trail.

### PB&T
Personal favorite. Tortillas can be used for just about everything. They're flat, light, and easy to carry. This is a great, simple lunch. Spread peanut butter on your tortilla, add a banana, roll, and eat. Really easy, really tasty, and high in carbs, protein, and potassium. You can always add things to spice it up: raisins, Tapatillo, honey, whatever…

### Hummus
Hummus is a middle eastern food that is made from chic peas (garbanzo beans), we like to use the powdered stuff (it's light) and add it to tortillas. Mix in some garlic, hot sauce or any kind of vegies for more flavor.

### Cheese & meat
Some sort of hard cheese (jalapeño pepper jack!) and fresh bread. Fresh bread is not always practical, but it can easily be substituted with tortillas. Add salami or sausage for a meat meal – it keeps well and tastes great with cheese and hummus.
