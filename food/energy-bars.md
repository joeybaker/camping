# Energy Bars
Much cheaper than buying a stack of power bars from a store. These recipes were all invented with a lot of experimentation.

## Pizza flavor
* 5 cup oatmeal
* 4 cup flour
* 3/4 cup oil
* 1 tbsp salt
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1/2 quart water
* tomato sauce – enough so the mix is redish
* various italian spices – season to taste
* finely diced onions – lots
* hot sauce – pick your own, we like Tapatillo®; season to taste

## Cinnamon raisin
* 1.5 cup oatmeal
* 7.5 cup flour
* 3/4 cup oil
* 1 tbsp salt
* 1/⁄2 cup sugar
* 2 quart water
* 1/3 cup cinnamon
* 2 cup raisins
* 3 tbsp nutmeg
* 8 tbsp vanilla

## Banana peanut butter
* 1.5 cup oatmeal
* 7.5 cup flour
* 3/4 cup oil
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1.75 quart water
* 1 cup ground peanuts
* 10 cup peanut butter
* 2 cup brown sugar
* 3/4 cup vanilla
* 10 cups (30) bananas
* 2 cups honey

## Baking directions
Place on thin baking sheet and level out, batter will not rise. Experiment with different thicknesses. We find that for the amount of batter above, two industrial large baking sheets are needed. Bake at 275ºF for at least 1.5 hours. You might need more time for all of the moisture to bake out. Let stand for at least an hour to cool, refrigerate until ready to use. Packed in plastic bags, these should last a week or more on the trail.

## Hardtack
Sort of the exact opposite of energy bars, hardtack made out of oatmeal, flour, salt, and oil. It's supposed to be salty and makes great snacking food.
