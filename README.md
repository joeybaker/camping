Camping
============

## Leave no trace
With use of wilderness areas increasing by more than a half million people every year, there is a greater need then ever to protect the areas that we travel to. Leave no Trace has been developed for this very purpose. It serves as more of an attitude then a set a rules for outdoor travel. Helping to protect the places that we travel to, both front-country and back-country.

### Plan ahead and prepare
* Plan to camp in established campsites. Leave yourself enough time to get to one, even in bad weather.
* Know what to do in case of an emergency.
* Know the weather ahead of time.
* Planned menus mean that trash and campfires a kept to a minimum.
* Outing will match the skill level of the participants.

### Travel and camp on durable surfaces
* Damage to outdoors areas occurs when visitors trample land beyond recovery.
* Use designated trails.
* In the back-country, hikers should
spread out to avoid extensive impact to any one area.
* Move back-country campsites daily to avoid creating permanent campsites.
* Try to camp on durable surfaces like snow, granite, gravel, sand, or compact soil.

### Pack it in, pack it out

* Avoid spilling or throwing out food. Pack your trash out with you. Accept the challenge of packing out your trash.
* Wastewater should be kept at least 200 feet from a water source. At that distance it is okay to use biodegradable soap.
* Catholes show be about 6 inches and 200 feet from water.
* The current thinking is that you should pack out your waste in areas that need extra protection. Bring plastic bags.

### Leave what you find

* Do not dig trenches, build chairs, or lean-tos.
* Never cut into live trees or plants.
* Leave the site better then you found it. Dismantle structures left by previous occupants
* Good campsites are found, not made.

### Minimize campfire impact
* The naturalness of campsites can degraded by many people scrounging for firewood.
* Stoves are a much more environmentally friendly option, and are much easier to cleanup.
* At higher elevations, firewood should not be collected as it is much more rare.
* Always use an existing campfire ring.
* Burn everything that you put into the
fire ring.
* Be sure that the fire is dead-out.

### Respect wildlife
* Don't try to approach wildlife. It is important for them to stay wild.
* Don't feed wildlife. It is important for them to stay wild.
* Give wildlife a wide berth. It is important for them to stay wild.
* Never leave food for the animals to eat. It is important for them to stay wild.

### Be considerate of other visitors
* Travel in small groups. Large groups degrade the land much easier.
* Keep the noise down, people are out to enjoy nature, not your boom box.
* Camp away from other people. Let them enjoy the solitude.
* Wear clothing that blends into the environment.
* Respect private property. Don't trespass.

## Emergency procedures

### Planning
Following this modified "Climbing code" is a good way to go:
* Leave the trip itinerary with a responsible person.
* Carry the necessary food, clothing, and equipment at all times.
* A climbing party of three is the minimum, unless adequate prearranged support is available.
* Keep the party together, and obey the leader _or_ majority rule.
* Never climb above your ability or knowledge.
* Never let judgment be overruled by desire when choosing the route or deciding
whether to turn back.
* Leave no Trace

## Navigation
### Maps
UTM coordinates were developed by the American military as a means of pinpointing just about anywhere on the globe down to the meter. These are way better then using the lat/long coordinate system that most people are used to.

Look for the blue tick marks of forest service quads.

### GPS
Don't rely exclusively on this cool tool. Batteries do run out!

### Gear
A GPS, 7.5 minute quads from the national forest service, and a compass will have you covered. They'll let you pinpoint anywhere you are and get help quick. One of the advantages of using the forest service maps is that all the search and rescue, rangers, sheriffs, fire departments, etcâ€¦ use the same maps.

Whistle are great! Don't forget to get these simple tools.
