# First aid
Getting hurt sucks. Don't.

## Constructing a kit
What follows is a pretty big kit, but it assures that you're covered for a lot of different types of situations. If you don't have someone who is a certified first responder (CFR) or better with you, you can probably skip things like blood pressure cuffs and stethoscopes.

Our bag weighs in at just under 6 lbs; 4.5 without stethoscope and BP cuff. One of the things you should keep in mind when designing a first aid kit for the back-country is that it is a good idea to substitute items that you already carry for items that are in the first aid kit.

For example, instead of carrying an extra pen light, just use a flash light. Use bandannas instead of triangular bandages, or just plan to use extra clothes in place of large gauze pads. We're only so good at taking our own advice.

Drugs are pretty hard to come by in the backcountry, ace bandages are amazing, and tape is an essential. Aside from that, pick and choose what you think you might need.
