## Stove
Using a backpacking stove is a much better option then lighting fires. Stoves come in two varieties: white gas and butane fuel. White gas is great because the stoves cook hot, tend to be more stable, and are easier to refuel. Butane stoves allow you to control the temperature, but do not have refillable canisters.

## Filter
When you're on your own, be sure to have 1 for every 3 people with you on the trail. Ceramic filters that are easy to clean are best.

## Tent
Consider going without one if you can. If it rains, you can use your ground cloth for protection. They are very hard to set up on some of the terrain â€“ like solid rock. If you do want a tent, get a 2 person backpacking tent. It should weigh around 5 lbs.

## Cookware
A frying pan and a couple of pots to boil water are a good idea. Lightweight and non-bulky are clearly preferred. You can always pack food into in some of the larger pots. You might even be able to fit a pot around the end of your sleeping bag.
