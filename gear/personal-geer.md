# Personal gear
## Backpack
External frames are old school. Pure internal frames are usually overkill for backpackers. Get a hybrid frame.

## Sleeping bag
You'll want a backpacking mummy bag rated for at least 20ºF. Synthetic bags will resist moisture better, but down bags are smaller. Remember, a wet sleeping bag does no good.

## Sleeping pad
The ground will steal your heat the fastest at night, so it is important to have a good pad. Thermarest® is the universal backpacker's favorite for its durability and light weight.

## Ground cloths
Are not strictly necessary, but it will help keep your sleeping bag and backpack clean. It also makes a handy tent if it starts to rain. Durable emergency blankets make great choices. They're just the right size for your sleeping bag, can give additional warmth, and have a shiny side that can be used for signaling in an emergency.

## Pack cover
They're cheap, small, and light pieces of waterproof cloth that everyone should have. You can also use a 50 gallon trash bag as the super cheap option.

## Trash bags
Everyone should carry 2-3 of these plastic wonders. They can serve as a pack cover, ground cloth, storage for wet clothes, etc… They're light and really small. There's no reason not to grab a few 50 gallon bags to carry with you.

## Clothes
You don't need to take too much with you when you're backpacking. You certainly don't need more then a few changes of clothes for the whole trip. You can do laundry on the trail. More then that and you're packing too heavy! Don't bring jeans, they're heavy and do not dry. Plan to dress in layers, several sweaters are better than one huge coat.

* 2-3 t-shirts
* Sleepwear
* 2 pair of shorts
* 1 pair long pants or just have 2 sets of
convertibles.
* 1 long sleeve shirt
* 1 medium weight jacket /fleece. This
should be water resistant and can serve as your rainwear.
* 1 hat, wide brims are best.
* 3 pairs of liner socks (polypropylene or
track socks work best)
* 2 pairs of outer socks (wool, or other
thick socks)

## Boots
Be sure to have solid hiking boots that are well broken in. Buy them well in advance and wear them around the house if need be. Waterproofed leather hiking boots are fine, but Gortex® is better. Either way, something that is breathable, but waterproof, is critical.

## Hiking poles
Many people find hiking poles to be a great help on the up and downhill segments.

## Pocket knife
Although the ubiquitous swiss army knife is popular, many backpackers find themselves only using the knife part of the knife and opt instead for a lock-blade. Usually around 3.5 inches long, these knives are easier to clean, and easier to keep sharp.

## Bandannas
Handy to have around, these pieces of cloth can serve many purposes.

## Flash light
Use it at night! Headlamps are fine too. Get LED flashlights they are brighter and last longer. Ensure your batteries are good to go before heading out.

## Mess kit
The [Orikaso®](http://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=orikaso) series are great. You can pick them up very cheaply from REI or other outdoors stores. They're very lightweight, keep the heat of your food longer than metal bowls, and fold totally flat in your pack. Carry a fork and spoon too, though sporks can be really great. Although there are mess kits that you can buy that include several pots that look like they collapse into one neat package, these are typically better avoided. They tend to be designed for one person on their own and unnecessary for group trekking.

## Gaiters
These are made from a tough synthetic material, that straps around your boots and your ankles to create a barrier between shrubbery and your legs. These can be a good idea if you don't want to wear long pants but want to protect your legs from getting scratched.

## Lighter/matches
Lighters are really preferred nowadays. They work wet, are light, and will start a lot more fires then a similar sized box of matches. That said, matches kept in a water- proof container work too.
